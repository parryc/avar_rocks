To the best of my abilities, I have collected various resources, both physically and digitally, on Avar. Some are certainly more useful than others and if I am able to provide any feedback on them, that feedback will be found directly under the resource in question. My heartfelt thanks to all those who have climbed this mountain before me – without your perseverance and skill, this site would never exist.
