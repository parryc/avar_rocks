# 🏔 Avar Rocks! ⛰

This repository is a collection of notes and resources for learning Avar. It is a constant work in progress – if you see information that is missing, information that is inaccurate, or whole sections you'd simply like to add, please let me know! You can either email me at [hello] @ [avar.rocks] or open an issue here in GitHub.

If you happen to be a speaker of Avar and are interested in teaching the Avar langauge as well – while I do not speak Avar, it is certainly a dream of mine to learn how.

You can find it all hosted on [avar.rocks](https://avar.rocks).
